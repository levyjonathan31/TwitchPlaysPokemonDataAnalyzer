# TwtichPlaysPokemonDataAnalyzer
Analyzes past data of user betting habits and number of bets on TwitchPlaysPokemon and makes an educated guess on which teams was likely a "safe" bet.
Currently uses arbitrary values to decide this but long term goal is to implement a ML approach to determine what the optimal values are for the parameters.
